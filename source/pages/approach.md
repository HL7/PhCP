The approach taken here is consistent with balloted implementation guides for FHIR. These publications view the ultimate implementation specification as a series of layered constraints.. Implementation guides such as this add constraints to FHIR through profiles that further define and restrict the sequence and cardinality of FHIR resources and the vocabulary sets for coded elements.

The development of this guide includes a review and analysis of the Pharmacist eCare Plan: Guidance on the Use of the HL7 CDA Consolidated Templates for Clinical Notes R2.1 Care Plan  and HL7/NCPDP CDA R2 Implementation Guide: Medication Therapy Management (MTM) Templates, Release 1 - US Realm.  Templates were re-used wherever possible. This guide tries to replicate the requirements of the CDA-based implementation guides using FHIR resources and profiles.
